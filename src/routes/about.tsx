              Founded in 2023 by Amardeep, Ethixweb specializes in helping US home service businesses — plumbing, HVAC and electrical

            <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Beyond home services, we also partner with select brands on custom web builds, headless migrations, conversion tracking
              setups and full-stack marketing support across industries. Based in India, with a US presence, serving clients across North America.
